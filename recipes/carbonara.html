                stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.<br>

            <br>

            <li>
                Place diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes.<br>
                Drain bacon on paper towels, reserving 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet.

            <br>

            <li>
                Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet. Add chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent.<br> 
                Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook 1 minute more.

            <br>

            <li>
                Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add cooked spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks together. <br>
                Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large fork, until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and toss again. 
                <br>Season with salt and pepper (<em>remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty</em>). 
            </li>
